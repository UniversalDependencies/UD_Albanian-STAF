# Summary

The UD-Albanian-STAF (Saarbruecken Treebank of Albanian Fiction) is a treebank of the Albanian language, comprising 202 randomly selected sentences from six fictional books published between 1963 and 2004.

# Introduction

The UD-Albanian-STAF treebank was initially automatically annotated using a Stanza model trained on unpublished Albanian treebanks, namely a seedbank treebank. Subsequently, the sentences in STAF were manually corrected by three Albanian native speakers. Finally, a review and further corrections were conducted.

# Acknowledgments

Many thanks to Nelda Kote and her group for providing me with their unpublished Albanian treebank (Kote et al. 2024), which served as the seedbank treebank to boostrap STAF. Anila Cepani and Rozana Rushiti provided invaluable information on the Albanian language and helped training our student assistant, Edita Luftiu, who served as the main annotator.
